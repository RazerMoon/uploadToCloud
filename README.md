Lets you upload files to the cloud.

Files are uploaded to [UFile.io](https://ufile.io/), find out about limits [here](https://ufile.io/#faq).

## Currently in Beta

* Not much testing has been done, there are likely many bugs to resolve

* Chunking not implemented, so if your file will take more than ~4 minutes to upload it will likely fail

* Optional API key not implemented

* No progress indicator
